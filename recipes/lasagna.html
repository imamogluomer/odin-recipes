    <h2>How to Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h2>
    <p>Here's a very brief overview of what you can expect when you make homemade lasagna:</p>

    <ul type="">
        <li>Make the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles.</li>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Layer the lasagna according to the recipe instructions.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna rest before serving.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>How to Layer Lasagna</h2>
    <p>The detailed layering instructions can be found in the recipe below, but this is the order you'll follow:</p>

    <ul type="">
        <li>Meat sauce</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Ricotta mixture</li>
        <li>Mozzarella slices</li>
        <li>Meat sauce</li>

        <li>Repeat the layers, then top with the remaining Parmesan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Long to Cook Lasagna</h2>
    <p>The assembled lasagna should take about 50 minutes to cook in an oven preheated to 375 degrees F. Cover it with
        foil for the first 25 minutes, then let it cook uncovered for the final 25 minutes. Also, it's important to let
        the lasagna rest at room temperature for about 15 minutes before you cut into it.</p>
