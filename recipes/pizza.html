    <h1>What is margherita pizza?</h1>

    <p>Invented in the 1800s, pizza margherita showcases the colors of the Italian flag: red from the tomato sauce,
        white from the mozzarella, and green from the basil. The story goes that the margherita is named after Queen
        Margherita of Savoy, an Italian queen in the 1800’s.</p>

    <h2>Tools for homemade margherita pizza</h2>
    <p>It’s easy to make margherita pizza with a few tools and tips! To get that authentic Italian crispy-on-the-outside
        crust, you need to bake it at a very high temperature. The key? A blazing hot pizza stone. Here are the tools
        you’ll need to make truly great pie:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pizza stone:</strong> This is what makes the crust crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.
            Here’s the pizza stone we recommend, and a bit more on how to care for it.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pizza peel:</strong> A peel is a paddle used to slide a pie onto the hot stone in the oven. We
            recommend this standard pizza peel or this conveyor pizza peel. The conveyor makes it incredibly easy to
            slide onto the stone (it’s worth the investment!).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pizza oven (optional):</strong>Pizza oven (optional): If you really want to step up your game, true
            artisan pizza is cooked at temperatures much hotter than your standard oven can achieve. Here’s the Ooni
            pizza oven we use: it’s relatively inexpensive and heats quickly to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit.

    <h2>How to make pizza dough</h2>
    <p>Great margherita pizza needs a great dough. Here at A Couple Cooks, we’ve been working on our recipe for over 10
        years. Our dough recipe incorporates tips from some of the premiere pizza chefs in America, who themselves have
        studied the pizza in Naples. Here’s what to know:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For next level dough, use Tipo 00 flour. The best flour is Tipo 00: it’s what Neapolitan pizza restaurants
            use. It makes for a beautiful, supple and fluffy dough. We buy our Tipo 00 flour online. All-purpose flour
            also works if you prefer, but Tipo 00 really makes a difference.
        </li>
        <li>Use a great pizza dough recipe! This Pizza Dough Master Recipe is the best method for fluffy, artisan-style
            pizza dough. You can make it using a stand mixer or knead it by hand. Or you can try Easy Thin Crust Pizza,
            which similar but rolled out using a rolling pin.

    <h2>Margherita pizza ingredients</h2>
    <p>In Italy, the traditional margherita pizza ingredients for toppings are mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, and
        basil. The sauce is generally made from crushed tomatoes, seasoned with garlic, salt and herbs. Often the cheese
        used is mozzarella di bufala, a fresh cheese made from the milk of water buffalos that has a creamy texture and
        delicate flavor. Because the toppings are so simple, they must be top quality. The margherita pizza ingredients
        you need are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes: </strong>This easy pizza sauce is quick and made with canned fire roasted tomatoes, olive
            oil, garlic, salt and herbs. Fire roasted tomatoes have a sweet smoky flavor and are easily available at
            most US grocery stores. Another great option is canned San Marzano tomatoes. If you can’t find either, use
            the best quality canned tomatoes you can find.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cheese:</strong> Use fresh mozzarella cheese, the kind sold in balls, then cut it into small pieces
            for overall coverage. A light topping of grated Parmesan cheese adds complexity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Basil:</strong>Basil: Using fresh basil is key to the flavor of a great margherita pizza. Make sure
            to add to the pizza after baking so that is stays beautifully green. Fresh basil that is baked in the oven
            turns black in minutes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make the pizza dough: Follow the Best Pizza Dough recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes
            to make and 45 minutes to rest.)
        </li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven (here’s the pizza oven we
            use).
        </li>
        <li>Make the pizza sauce: Cut the garlic into a few rough pieces. Place the garlic, tomatoes, olive oil, oregano
            and kosher salt in a blender. Blend until fully combined. (You’ll use about ⅓ cup for the pizza; reserve the
            remaining sauce and refrigerate for up to 1 week.)
        </li>
        <li>Prepare the cheese: If using fresh mozzarella cheese, slice it into ¼ inch thick pieces (see the photos of
            the pre-baked pizza above). If it’s incredibly watery fresh mozzarella (all brands vary), you may want to
            let it sit on a paper towel to remove moisture for about 15 minutes then dab the mozzarella with the paper
            towel to remove any additional moisture.
        </li>
        <li>Bake the pizza: When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t
            have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel
            is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see How to Stretch Pizza Dough for
            instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.
        </li>
        <li>Spread a thin layer of the pizza sauce over the dough, using about ¼ to ⅓ cup. Add the mozzarella cheese.
            Top with a thin layer of fresh grated Parmesan cheese and a few pinches of kosher salt.
        </li>
        <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the
            cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).
        </li>
        <li>Allow the pizza to cool for a minute or two before adding the basil on top (whole leaves, lightly torn, or
            thinly sliced). Slice into pieces and serve immediately.
        </li>
